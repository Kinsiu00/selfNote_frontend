# Self-Note / Note-To-Self

Originally scoped to provide email/text message reminders to a user, has expanded to be able to send text/email to any email or phone. (texting requires reciever's carrier)
Currently supports AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, and email.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo as well as the back-end component, found [here](https://github.com/Kinsiu00/selfNote_backend). <br>
In the backend root directory, run "npm install" to install the proper middleware and other needed components.

### Prerequisites

- Some knowledge of PostgreSQL
- A cellphone number with one of the supported carriers
- An email address

### Installing

NOTE: the current database needs to be configured to your database.
- In your terminal, run 'createdb {DATABASE}'
- In knexfile.js, change the connection to: 'postgres://localhost/{DATABASE}'.
  - on Linux and Windows systems, PostgreSQL may require a username/password for PostgreSQL. Please refer to PostgreSQL 
  documentation for details: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/client-authentication.html
  - ie: 'postgres://{USERNAME}:{PASSWORD}@localhost/{DATABASE NAME}'
- Run the command "knex migrate:latest" to set up the table in the database.

Once the database and connection has been set up, simply run "npm start" in the root directory of the backend.

## How to use

Start by creating an entry. Date format is in YYYY/MM/DD, Time is in the 24hr style. (ie: 1644 is 4:44pm)
Once an entry has been logged, the server will check every minute until the time has elapse. At this point, the server will send the entry and clear the entry from the list.
NOTE: The entry will "remain" until the page is refreshed.

An entry can be edited at any time, keep in mind the date and time will reset to the current time. (to allow for easier measurement)

## Built With

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) - service used to send messages.
* [PostgreSQL](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used for the database.
